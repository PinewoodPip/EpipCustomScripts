This repository contains various scripts intended to be used with Epip's "Custom Scripts" feature.

These scripts consist of a mix of:
- Epip API examples
- Super-specific features or tweaks that someone asked for but were unfitting as a setting/feature in Epip itself
- For-fun shenanigan scripts (which also double as API examples)

For details on how to use this system as a script developer, see the [documentation on Epip's site](http://pinewood.team/epip/Features/CustomScripts).

## Usage
